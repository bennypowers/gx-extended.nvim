# ‚≠ê gx-extended.nvim

A Neovim plugin that extends the functionality of the gx mapping.
In Neovim, the `gx` mapping in normal mode allows you to navigate to the url under the cursor. This plugin extends that behaviour to more than just urls.

## üéâ Built-in Features
- `package.json` - `gx` when cursor is under an npm dependency, nagivates to _https://www.npmjs.com/package/[packageName]_
- `plugins.lua` - In packer.nvim's convention `plugins.lua` file, `gx` when cursor is under an npm dependency, nagivates to _https://github.com/[user/org]/[repo]_

## üöÄ Showcase
With a custom extension for opening the registry docs for aws terraform resources

## üì¶ Installation

```lua
use {
  'rmagatti/gx-extended.nvim',
  config = function()
    require('gx-extended').setup {}
  end
}
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è  Configuring
You can pass custom extensions to the `extensions` table. Each extension should have at least two properties:
1. `autocmd_pattern`, a list of file patterns to run the autocomands for
2. `match_to_url`, a function to run the match and return the composed url to be used by the `gx` command

The following is an example of hitting `gx` on a terraform file on a line where an aws resource is defined and opening your browser directly on the terraform registry documentation for the specific resource.
```lua
use {
  'rmagatti/gx-extended.nvim',
  config = function()
    require("gx-extended").setup {
      extensions = {
        {
          autocmd_pattern = { "*.tf" },
          match_to_url = function(line_string)
            local resource_name = string.match(line_string, 'resource "aws_([^"]*)"')
            local url = "https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/" .. resource_name

            return url
          end,
        },
      },
    }
  end
```

## TODOs
- Implement `visual` mode
